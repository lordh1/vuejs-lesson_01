    <h1>What are Views?</h1>
    <p><strong>Actually views are components.</strong><p>
    <p>It's your choice, if You separate views into other directory or not. I wanted just to mention about them, but i prefer organizing components inside 'components' directory.</p>
    <p>In general Views role is to be a container for other components, or just an simple HTML page placed inside 'template' tag without any JavaScript code.</p>
